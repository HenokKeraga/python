Day 1 :
Introduction to python
————————————

Software necessary

Anaconda : individual 
 Jupyter notebook - user friendly interpreter

New ->Python3
Cell 
Give instruction to do some thing 
print(“hello world”)
Shift +enter =run
Variable => point to particular memory location


Why programming? 
Develop application and games
Automate
Real time algorithm
Track of historic data and analyses => data science
Improve customize system
Better experience to end user
Stream lining of process 


Q: Why python for data science ? 
Simple and easy
High level language
Portable  like java
Support difference programming paradigm
(Procedure OP and OOP)
Extensible (C /c++) java
Library support

Phyton Used 

Web scrapping
Testing
Web development
Data analysis

Python interpreter
—Executing the code
Anaconda prompt 
Python => print(“hello”) => one line at  a time

Comment  => #  or “””……  “”” threeple double cote
Literal constant
Identifier
Variable

Data type

Immutable data type
Numbers
String
Tuples  — array = no assignment the value ()


Mutable data tap
List []  
Dictionaries  - key value paris { : } 
Sets {} no colon

Operator
Conditional statement

Google colab
